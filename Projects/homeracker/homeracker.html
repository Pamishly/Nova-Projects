        <h1>HomeRacker</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My 3d printed server rack.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm going to start this off by explainging that this isn't my own original project.<a href="https://homeracker.org/">HomeRacker</a> was originally made by Kellervater. I highly recommend subscribing to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kellerlabs">channel</a></p>
        <p>You can find all the official documentation of the original project on the <a href="https://homeracker.org/">HomeRacker</a> website, this page is for my custom parts and my assembly.</p>
        <p>My rig has 3 Matx computers stacked on top of a HP Aruba 48 PoE Switch.</p>
        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>I have my systems labeled as PC1, PC2, and PC3. PC1 being at the bottom and PC3 at the top. Their operating systems are listed below. I would also list their purpose however I use these for experimenting so it is constantly changing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PC3 - Windows 10</li>
          <li>PC2 - Windows 10</li>
          <li>PC1 - Truenas Scale</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Custom Parts</h2>
        <h3>Motherboard Mounts</h3>
        <p>There are 2 custom motherboard mounts made for this setup. Mount A and Mount B. The only difference is the location of the mounting points for the HomeRacker frame. They can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7193489">here</a></p>
        <h3>PSU Mounts</h3>
        <p>Yet again we have 2 variations, the top mount needed to be longer to connect to the frame properly. They can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7193495">here</a></p>
        <h3>Fan Mounts</h3>
        <p>The last piece with 2 variations is the fan mounts, the bottom mount had to be mounted differently due to its placement on the frame. The downloads can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7193492">here</a></p>
        <h3>3.5in Cage</h3>
        <p>My assembly has 5 3.5in drives running on it so to mount them I modified this cage. I had run into a problem with the cage flexing out in the center area and not allowing the caddies to sit properly so I fixed it with a long nut and a bolt applying pressure horizontally across the center to keep it from flexing out. You can find them <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7193491">here</a> </p>
        <h3>2.5in Mount</h3>
        <p>I also use 2.5in drives in my setup so instead of printing adapters to put them in the 3.5in cage I found a place to mount them within the rest of the rack and that can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7193499">here</a></p>
        <h2>Assembly</h2>
        <p>All the custom parts and layout for this project was done in blender, I normally use Onshape but it was easiest to go blender this time and it worked. For the custom parts I had to run them through the microsoft repair program available in PrusaSlicer for them to slice properly. You can download the .blend file from <a href="https://github.com/Pamishly/Nova-Projects/raw/refs/heads/main/Files/Rack%20Setup.blend">this button</a></p>
        <p>I printed the rack personally using an Elegoo Nepute 3 Pro with PLA+ and it has yet to give me any more problems than previously listed.</p>
